# Mapping Earthquakes
## Overview of Project
This project was done to use JavaScript and Leaflet to add more information to the original project. The clients would like to see earthquake data in relation to tectonic plate locations, with an option to see just earthquakes with greater magnitudes.

### Project goals
The goals were to:
* Add an overlay layer showing the tectonic plates of the earth
* Add an overlay layer showing earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.
* Add another base layer option

### Skills
The skills practiced were:
* Make API requests for earthquake and geographic information and host results on a local server
* Use JavaScript and GeoJSON data to build maps with interactive features and layers 
* Use Leaflet control plugins to add user interface controls

## Results
The additional layers make it easy to see that the earthquake locations tend to be along the fault lines where tectonic plates connect. The connection is more apparent when the “Major Earthquakes” and “Tectonic Plates” layers are shown together and the “dark” map option is enabled.

Additional experiences and lessons:
* GitHub branching: Create a branch off the main branch, add/commit/push data to the branch, then merge
* JavaScript troubleshooting
* Visual Studio Code extensions for improved readability of JavaScript and raw data
